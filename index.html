            Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach
            <em>technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magical ability to take
            command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes
            everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts,
            <strong><em>GOOGLE</em></strong>Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.
            We believe there are at least a billion people who can benefit from
            learning technical sophistication, probably more. To join our
